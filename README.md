# üß† Signature Work Reflection ‚Äì Georges Macheta  
*CISC 480 ‚Äì Senior Capstone | University of St. Thomas | Spring 2025*

## üìå Introduction

Over the past four years, my academic and extracurricular journey in computer science has been shaped by a deep curiosity to understand the human condition and create technology that reflects compassion, creativity, and responsibility. From creative coding to national hackathons to socially informed algorithm design, my projects represent a desire to build with purpose. This reflection brings together three interdisciplinary projects that showcase the range of my work‚Äîfrom music education to hackathon product design to public health‚Äîand how each connects to a broader vision for the common good. As a proud Tommie and Syrian student, my work is rooted in the mission of the University of St. Thomas: to advance the common good through innovation, inclusion, and service.

## üé∂ Solfege Hand Sign Interpreter  
**GitHub:** [Solfege Hand Sign Interpreter](https://github.com/georges-macheta/solfege-hand-interpreter)

This project was created for DIMA 259 ‚Äì Creative Coding and bridges art, education, and real-time technology. The system uses p5.js and ml5.js to detect solfege hand signs via webcam and plays corresponding musical notes using the Web Audio API. It was inspired by my experience with music theory and a desire to make musical instruction more accessible to students with limited resources.

By tracking hand gestures and mapping them to pitch, the tool creates a fully interactive ear training and performance platform that can benefit music educators and learners, particularly those in underserved schools. The project aligns with the St. Thomas value of promoting human flourishing through interdisciplinary creativity.

## üì± D3Lite ‚Äì CruzHacks 2024  
**GitHub:** [D3Lite App](https://github.com/georges-macheta/d3lite)

D3Lite was developed during the CruzHacks 2024 Hackathon at UC Santa Cruz. It is a Flutter-based mobile app designed to make goal-setting and self-improvement more structured for Gen Z users. Built entirely over one weekend with my team, the app features journal-based check-ins, streak tracking, and customizable ‚Äúmodes‚Äù for mindfulness, productivity, or fitness.

This project pushed me to combine front-end design (Flutter) with psychological research and real-time user feedback. While it began as a technical sprint, it quickly evolved into a reflection of how behavioral science and software can be paired for wellbeing. This work reflects the St. Thomas commitment to holistic education and supporting human development beyond the classroom.

## üó£ LectureLounge ‚Äì SpartaHack at Michigan State  
**GitHub:** [LectureLounge](https://github.com/georges-macheta/LectureLounge)

LectureLounge is a web platform built during SpartaHack 2024 to make classroom discussions more inclusive and accessible. The idea came from our shared frustration that some students, especially international and neurodivergent students, feel less comfortable speaking in large group settings. LectureLounge allows students to submit real-time feedback and discussion prompts anonymously during class sessions, using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and a responsive front-end.

What began as a technical challenge became a deeper conversation about inclusion, equity, and classroom dynamics. I consider this one of my most values-aligned projects‚Äîdeeply rooted in the Tommie commitment to dignity, belonging, and academic access for all.

## üåû Subject Matter: The Vitamin D3 Calculator

One of the most meaningful projects I‚Äôve worked on is a Python-based tool to calculate sun exposure needs for natural Vitamin D3 synthesis. While this was not part of a formal course, I include it here because it showcases how computing can directly address real human health needs‚Äîespecially among populations like mine with darker skin tones or limited access to sunlight.

The algorithm is based on medically established relationships between UV index, skin pigmentation (Fitzpatrick scale), and age-based efficiency of D3 production. Here's a breakdown of its logic:

- **Inputs:** Fitzpatrick skin type (1‚Äì6), current UV index, age
- **Calculation:** Adjusts baseline exposure time (8.5 mins at UV index 7 for pale skin) using multipliers based on skin tone, age (‚â•70 needs more), and UV strength
- **Output:** Personalized minutes + seconds needed in the sun
- **Extension:** Compares to simulated time already spent outdoors and reports whether more sun is needed

### üî¨ Why It Matters

Vitamin D3 deficiency is a global issue linked to bone health, immunity, and mood. It disproportionately affects people with darker skin and those living at high latitudes‚Äîespecially in immigrant and low-income populations who may not supplement or have regular access to outdoor space.

By encoding a public health formula into a personalized, explainable tool, this algorithm allows individuals to understand and optimize their health behavior. It transforms vague guidance like ‚Äúgo outside more‚Äù into concrete, science-based action.

This project embodies everything I believe in as a computer scientist: responsible innovation, culturally aware design, and using computation to inform and empower individuals. It also exemplifies the St. Thomas mission to contribute to the common good and health equity.

## üåç Concluding Reflection

From sound to self-care to sunlight, my projects reflect a wide-ranging but connected exploration of how computing can serve human dignity. The Signature Work Portfolio has allowed me to reflect not just on what I‚Äôve built, but why I build: to lower barriers, to make knowledge more accessible, and to design ethically with people in mind.

Each of these projects has pushed me beyond lines of code‚Äîtoward understanding behavior, culture, biology, and bias. Whether it‚Äôs through music education, inclusive classrooms, or personalized health tools, I‚Äôve sought to make technology more human.

I am grateful to the University of St. Thomas and the faculty who challenged me to think bigger, act with purpose, and grow into both a software engineer and a servant leader.
